Extended euclidean GCD (fact, find equations, retroative substitution)
Fermat theorem's (a^(p-1) = 1 (MOD p))
Phi Euler -> phi(N) = (2^3 - 2^2) * (3^1 - 3^0) * (p^n - p^(n-1))  (number of coprimes (Ai, m), (Ai+1, m), ... (An-1, m))
Bezout Theorem  (gcd(a, b) == d)  =>  then exists intergers x, y  (ax + by == d)

OBS:
- for x^n (MOD M), if N > MOD, do N = N MOD Phi(N)
